It implements an autoencoder for denoising noisy input images and combines it with a classifier for digit recognition. The process involves preprocessing the data with added noise, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, early stopping and model checkpointing techniques are applied to ensure effective training and prevent overfitting."
